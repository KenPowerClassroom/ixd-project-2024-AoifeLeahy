            <td class = "Question"><b>Engagement: </b> How engaging is the app? Is it appealing? Does it have sound and animation to capture the user's attention? Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward?</td>
            <td class = "answer">Kahoot is a very engaging app, which contains many colours to make it visually appealing to look at. When joining and playing a game, there are animations and audio in the background to motivate you into continuing to play the game. There is a leaderboard to motivate the user into continuing to guess correctly so that they can be in the top 3. 10/10 </td>
            <td class = "answer">Typing.com is both engaging and appealing, as it has typewriter sounds when a keyboard button is clickes and also happy sounds and animations of stars when you complete a lesson. It has a good balance of challendes and rewards, as when completing a lesson, you will get a score out of 3 stars. There is also a challenge of getting 100% accuracy. 10/10</td>
            <td class = "answer2">SoloLearn is an engaging app, however it is not the most appealing compared to others in competition with it. The first page, the user has an option to sign up or log in, however, the background is black with only a few stars in the corners. This doesn't quite catch the user's attention as it is bland. There is a leaderboard when you sign in that is hidden in the menu, so it is quite forgettable to the user. 7/10</td>

            <td class = "Question" ><b>Progress tracking: </b> How well does the app track the user's progress? Does it provide feedback and recommendations to help users improve their performance? Does it use data to personalize the learning experience?</td>
            <td class = "answer"> The app efficiently tracks the users progress. When showing results of the latest question asked, there is a leaderboard shown between each question, which shows who is winning and losing. The app will also tell you how many points you are behind the person in front, in order to catch up to them. This helps the user improve their performace as they are then motivated to perform well and win. 9/10</td>
            <td class = "answer"> The app is very good at tracking the user's progress, as it gives feedback of your typing speed, accuracy and time. It shows the user how many lessons they have completed and how many more they have left in order to complete the lesson as a whole. When you finish the whole lesson, it shows the user how many starts they have earned. It uses the data of the users performance to personalize their own learning experience. 10/10</td>
            <td class = "answer2"> The user's progress is tracked well, as there is a progress bar on top of all the lessons that you have finished and yet to complete. The progress bar also shows when you are in the lesson. However, there is no feedback to the user to improve their performance. There is a hint at the top of the screen, however you need enough gems to get the hint. If the user does not have enough gems and does not know the answer, they will have a choice of getting the question wrong, you will have to look elsewhere on the internet for the answer.6/10 </td>

            <td class = "Question"><b>User experience: </b> How user-friendly is the app? Is it easy to navigate and use? Does it have clear instructions and prompts? Does it have a well-designed interface?</td>
            <td class = "Answer"> The app is very user-friendly as it is easy to navigate and use for first time users. However, the front page of the website is a bit crowded with colours and sales that are happening. This makes it a little harder to find the button to click to join or create a game. When joining a game, it has clear instructions of where to enter the name and profile picture/animal you have chosen. It has a well-designed interface, as it it appealing to look and enjoyable. 9/10</td>
            <td class = "Answer"> This app provides a very strong user-friendly app. It very easy to understand how to navigate the app as it is well-structured and has it's own design to make it easy to use. It has clear instructions as on the front page, there is a clear prompts on whether the user wants to 'start typing today' or 'sign up now'. There is also a bright and vibrant start button to start the lesson you have chose. 10/10</td>
            <td class = "Answer"> SoloLearn is an easy to use and navigate app, as it clearly states at the bottom of the screen, when the user is signed in, the courses progress that they have obtained. It is easy to use for first time users, as the app is quite plain so doesn't draw the user's attention away from something important that they are looking for. It means that it is well-structred and the design was thoroughly planned and thought out. 9/10</td>
